          <h3>My journey into tech</h3>
          <p> Tech was never a plan growing up, I was never gonna end up here. The idea seemed almost out of reach, growing up it was all about medicine and medical science. Funny how life has a way of unfolding in unexpected directions.</p>

          <h3>Gap year</h3>
          <p>The journey started in the fall of 2023, half-way into my gap year from uni after trying both nursing and social studies degree. It somehow just never felt right, something was missing so I decided to take a break from school and rethink about my career. </p>

          <h3>The epiphany</h3>
          <p> A quite day at work, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a post about coding. It was like a light bulb went off in my head, I was so intrigued by the idea of creating something out of nothing. I decided to give it a try and the rest is history.</p>
